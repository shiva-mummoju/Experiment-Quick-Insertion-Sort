# Experiment-Quick-Insertion-Sort
This is a code to show why and how Quick-Insertion-sort is better than the regular Quick-Sort. Whenever the partition in the quick-sort becomes less than a threshold value, we shift towards Insertion-Sort. This experiment also gives us what the optimum threshold value (M) is. Here we run the experiment for an array of 10000 elements for 10000 times. We table the time taken for various threshold values of M (1-50). Also we find that the threshold value changes for the change in range of values (K). This experiment is in no way an efficient way to implement quick-insertion-sort. But merely to prove why and how it is better and to find out the optimum threshold value. We table the number of writes, number of reads and number of swaps done in each case.
